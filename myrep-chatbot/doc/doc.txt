This is the doc for Drew's prog6 final assignment.
Basically the main changes are quality of life so it's more clear to unfamiliar programmers.
Some additional helper comments, methods, and variables are used.
Formatting for readability.
It's used the same as prog5 and will for the most part have similar outputs.
Some additional code is made for "confidence" and extra inputs, as can be seen.
The logging is made as you use it so if you want to use that part, use it normally first.
