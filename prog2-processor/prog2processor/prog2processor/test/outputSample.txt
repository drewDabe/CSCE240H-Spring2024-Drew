ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES
All of our retail stores are leased. Store leases typically provide for a lease term of one to five years, plus renewal options. This arrangement gives us the flexibility to pursue extension or relocation opportunities that arise from changing market conditions. We believe that, as current leases expire, we will be able to obtain either renewals at present locations or leases for similar locations in the same area.
The terms of the store leases for the 4,413 leased stores open as of January 28, 2023 expire as follows.
Lease Terms to Expire During		Number
of Stores
Fiscal 2023		1,723 	
Fiscal 2024		891 	
Fiscal 2025		690 	
Fiscal 2026		395 	
Fiscal 2027 and later		714 	
Total		4,413 	
 
In July of 2020, we sold and leased-back, in separate unrelated transactions, to unaffiliated third parties: i) our corporate headquarters and ancillary office space in Grapevine, Texas and ii) a nearby refurbishment center. In August of 2020, we sold and leased-back our Australian headquarters in Eagle Farm, Queensland to an unaffiliated third party. In September of 2020, we sold and leased-backed our Canadian headquarters in Brampton, Ontario to an unaffiliated third party.
As of January 28, 2023, we owned three and leased 14 office and distribution facilities, totaling approximately 2.7 million square feet. The lease expiration dates for the leased facilities range from 2023 to 2032, with an average remaining lease life, including reasonably certain options, of approximately seven years.
